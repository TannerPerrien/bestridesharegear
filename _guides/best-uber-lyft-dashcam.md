This guide will help you explore the best dash cams. Cameras protect you from two types of threats: people outside of your car and people inside of your car. Outside of your car, a camera can protect you from disgruntled drivers or pedestrians who are not paying attention. Inside your car a camera can [discourage destructive behavior][accuse 1] from violent or intoxicated passengers, reduce the chance of [false accusations][accuse 2], or worst case scenario help you prove your innocence.

## Buying Guide

The {{ cam.name }} is currently the most widely used dash cam for Uber and Lyft drivers. This is the case because it excels in all of the following categories and criteria. If you're considering another camera, compare with these tips to help guide your decision.

### Installation

It is important to consider placement for your camera. Suction cup mounts offer the most versatility, but caution should be exercised with these as you do not want to block your vision of the road. The other option is a mount that attaches to your existing rear view mirror. Mounts that attach to your existing mirror help you maintain the same visibility you have without a camera.

Cheap cameras use cheap parts. Nothing in worse than a suction cup that doesn't hold the camera. A failing suction cup means missed recording footage and/or a broken camera!

### Video Resolution

The resolution that a camera records video is an extremely important factor. The thing to look for here is "full HD." The higher the resolution, the better the video quality will be. The cameras listed here are at least 1080p (full HD), which simply means they provide  high quality video that shows you every detail!

### Memory

Dash cameras record continuously while the vehicle is running. This works by recording over the old video footage on the memory card. An 8 GB card will give you around 5 hours of video recording history. The models here are all upgradeable in case you are looking for something that holds a longer history.

### Night Vision

While not required to record video in the dark, night vision makes capturing high quality video much easier when it is dark. Cameras without this have to increase exposure time to allow enough light into the lens. Long exposures often result in blurry images. Night vision helps you avoid blurriness and retain a high quality video when the sun goes down.

### Gravity Sensor

Cameras like the KDLINKS X1 have a gravity sensor that is able to detect when an accident occurs. If an accident is detected, this mechanism kicks in and locks your memory so that you will not accidentally delete the current video.

### GPS

Cameras with integrated GPS record location data into the video. This is helpful to prove your direction, speed, and route in the event of an accident. Higher end cameras have built in GPS. Lower end units can either have GPS added as an extra option or may not have this ability at all.

### Switch On / Off

The cameras listed in this guide will automatically turn on and start recording when you start your vehicle. This is a crucial feature as you do not want a forgetful moment plus a traffic accident to result in you having no video proof! Likewise, the cameras in this guide will automatically turn off with the vehicle. However, the cameras can optionally be set to record for some period of time after the vehicle powers off. Doing so requires that the camera has an internal battery that will give it 30 seconds to 2 minutes or more of record time.
